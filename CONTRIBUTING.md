[How to Contribute on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project)

#### Some simple contributing rules:
- One template or one section + template per one PR
- Template sections name are based on a core framework of this template, such as FastAPI or Django. If it is a template for an ML, Science, Math, etc., add this information to the short description and PR.
- No need to add similar templates. Since there are many templates in the world, there is no point in adding similar templates â€” such PRs will be rejected.
- If you have a template and there is a similar, more starred template, then it makes sense to add a change to that template rather than duplicating it.
- No need to write in the short description that this is a template, for Python, etc.
- If possible, the short description should include a brief list of functions, libraries, etc. included in this template.
- See how other links are formatted. If this template is based on cookiecutter, you need to add emojis, etc.
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove any trailing whitespace.
- Be polite and positive! Happy contributing! :blush:
