[How to Contribute on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project)

#### Some simple contributing rules:
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- One PR per one change (one template + one new section is one change)
- Make rebase before PR
- Try to maintain the general style and logic of this awesome list
- Template sections name are based on a core framework of this template, such as FastAPI or Django. If it is a template for an ML, Science, Math, etc., add this information to the short description and PR
- No need to add similar templates. Since there are many templates in the world, there is no point in adding similar templates — such PRs will be rejected
- If you have a template and there is a similar, more starred template, then it makes sense to add a change to that template rather than duplicating it
- If possible, the short description should include a brief list of functions, libraries, etc. included in this template
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Remove any trailing whitespace
- Be polite and positive! Happy contributing. :blush:
